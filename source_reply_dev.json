Evidence of these \u201ctransitional forms,\u201d as they are called, should be abundant. \n\nFirstly, no scientist expects fossil evidence to be \"abundant.\" [Fossilisation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fossil#Fossilization_processes) is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. \n\nSecondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a \"transitional form\" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask \"Where's the transitional form between A and B?\" Futurama summarised this \"debate\" process [rather well](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TTOla3TyfqQ)","cq6fj7f":"The others have given good answers, and I would like to add http:\/\/rationalwiki.org\/wiki\/Answers_in_Genesis to the mix.\n\nBut over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:\n\n1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.\n\n2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.\n\n3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.\n\n4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.\n\nSo, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...\n\na) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.\n\nb) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.\n\nc) The bible literalists are wrong.\n\nPersonally, I'm leaning towards 'c' as the most likely answer.","cq6dipq":"&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs (i.e., their bones), and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists\u2019 story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old\n\nThis is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stratum) in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.\n\nYou can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about 50,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is 80 million years old, and below a stratum you know is 60 million years old, that fossil must be between 60 and 80 million years old.\n\nhttp:\/\/evolution.berkeley.edu\/evosite\/lines\/IIIAchronology.shtml","cq6s9ur":"Look up AronRa on youtube, watch his \"foundational falsehoods of creationism\" series.

Most cities main water pipes were constructed 50 - 100+ years ago and contain a large amount of lead.. even homes built before 1986 may contain lead pipes and lead solder.  As the pipes corrode lead enters the water supply.\n\nThe biggest difference between ingesting lead and fluoride is fluoride is water soluble lead is not.  So your body will get rid of fluoride (like it does with most things you ingest), lead on the other hand is a heavy metal and your body has no way of dealing with it.  Over time, the lead builds up in our system causing toxicity  This is known as bioaccumulation.\n ","d1rfaf8":"Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.\n\nThe website refers to this study: http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/laneur\/article\/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3\/fulltext#article_upsell.  The paragraph on fluoride reads: \"A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose\u2013response association would be desirable.\" \n\nIf you click on the reference 44, it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links).  Here is selected text from the skeptics (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3621182\/):\"Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. 2012), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of 0.4 in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. 2007; Rothman et al. 2008; Szklo and Nieto 2007) even though it was statistically significant.\"\n\nSo the article on the website makes a big deal about 1 paragraph in a review article (Level 5 evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level 1 evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a 0.4-point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.\n\nTL:DR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD).

Double whammy.","d23k9ry":"One thing \"scare articles\" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. \n\nThe whole thing came about as a result of a condition called \"texas teeth\".  Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay.  The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water.  Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked.  So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it.  Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection.\n\nI'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride.  At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water.  However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it.\n\nMy mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available.  My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager.  My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it.  Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios.  My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school \"treatment\" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes.

Some people just made the wrong choice.\n\nIf somebody lands themselves in prison for life for continuously stealing, that was their choice.  It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested.  \n\n&gt;Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.\n\nNot if you're getting life in prison for committing the exact same crime three times.  Life in prison for repeat offenders makes sense.  Your sentence increases every time you repeat an offense, so eventually, your sentence will expire after you expire.  There's a way to avoid that, however.  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again.  ","dpvqhnq":"Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law?  What?  How do you eat when you don't have a job?

Some of these people have lost touch with reality.\n\n&gt;  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again. \n\nThat's a really nice thought.

Sentence someone to five years, ten years.  Hell, sentence them to thirty years and that's probably *still* less than life in prison. Thirty years! For stealing three belts! Who's heartless enough to do that to a person? After thirty years your old life would be unrecognizable.  It doesn't make sense to punish someone that long because they're not even the same person they were when they committed the crime.

It\u2019s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.\n\n&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.\n\n&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.\n\n&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s how it usually goes:\n\n&gt;Local: I\u2019ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.\n\n&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it\u2019s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. Isn\u2019t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?\n\n&gt;Well, actually\u2026\n\n&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don\u2019t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we\u2019ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.\n\n&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.\n\n&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why \u2018\u2019immigrants\u2019\u2019 continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn\u2019t be controversial.\n\n&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you\u2019ve reminded us enough, thanks.\n\n&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn\u2019t clarify anything. It doesn\u2019t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that \u2018\u2019not all immigrants are like that\u2019\u2019, are actually saying is, \u2018\u2019I\u2019m not like that.\u2019\u2019 Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they\u2019d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.\n\n&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and \u2018Well Done For Not Raping Anybody\u2019 badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.\n\n&gt; If you are an immigrant and don\u2019t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn\u2019t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local\u2019s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.\n\nI can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.\n\n**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**\n\nAnd it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.\n\nMy very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. \n\nAnd as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the \"oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.\"\n\nChange the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. \n\nSome men.\n\nA minority of men.\n\nA sub-population of men.\n\nCertain kinds of men.\n\nWhatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.\n\nBut not all men. \n\nYou're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. \n\nAnd on a side-note: the \"lived experiences\" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about \"lived experiences\", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.\n\nAlt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.\n\nLived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.\n\nI won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. \n\nThis is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.","dyycadh":"So basically more immigrants = safer america.\n\nMakes you wonder why trump wants to ban all immigration and build the wall.","dyydlzc":"Because it's red meat to his base.","dyy36i4":"I don't like articles\/opinions that don't source anything...

Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The organization has also drawn criticism for its financial and intellectual ties to extremist racists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009 connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation (SPLC).
