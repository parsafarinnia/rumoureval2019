Parental reports were more accurate indicators of the presence of additives than clinical tests.[19] Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients, including artificial colors, were eliminated from school food programs.[20][21]\"\n\nThere is some scientific validity to what she is saying.

This infographic doesn't show that 6 companies control 90% of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the 90% figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that 6 companies create and\/or distribute a lot of media content. \n\nThere are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it. \n\nEDIT: Ok, let's explore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me.\n\n&gt; *\u201cMedia has never been more consolidated. 6 media giants now control a staggering 90% of what we read, watch or listen to.\u201d*\n\nThe most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator (the 6 media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume). In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in 1983 to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in 1983.  \n\n*&gt; \"232 Media executives control the information diet of 277 million Americans\"*\n\nWhere do these numbers come from?  How does he arrive at 232 media executives? What constitutes \"executive\" or \"control\" or an executive with control? The infographic does not explain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. \n\n\nThe infographic says the Comcast\/NBC merger guarantees \"monopoly of 11 US markets like NYC and Chicago.\" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel\/content producer\/network, so in what sense did the merger create a \"monopoly\" in 11 markets?  \n\n*&gt; \"In 1995, the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than 40 stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over 1,500.\"*\n\nIn 1996, Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. \n\nBut, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations.\n\nIn any event, \"80% of stations' playlists match\" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As exotic as those yankees\/southerners\/west coasters\/midwesterners\/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different.  Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country\/rap\/alternative\/jazz\/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top 40 mostly like the same bands and songs.  \n\nRadio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting \"burned\" and what songs audiences like (or might like). There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If \"more new music\/more variety\" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. \n\n*&gt; \"The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in 2010, that's 2X the box office sales of the next 140 Studios*\"\n\nWait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants \"control\" the media by owning everything.  But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than \"the next 140 studios\". If there are 146 studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the \"Big 6\"....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the \"Big 6\" for distribution. \n\nAnd finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: \"Until regulations return (or they buy each other out of existence), they will continue to control 90% of everything Americans see, hear and consider important.\"\n\nSounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the \"media consolidation\" Pollyanna's [were saying 15 years ago](https:\/\/transition.fcc.gov\/ownership\/roundtable_docs\/cooper-a.pdf). \n\n&gt; \"The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media.\"\n\nYeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? \n\n&gt; \"The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation\u2026. Between March 1999 and March 2001, the total number of companies controlling 50 percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from 11 to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position (over 30 percent of user time) the HHI is about 1200, well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. \n\nYes, 15 years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would \"control\" online media.  Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. \n\nThere are big media companies. There always have been. We'll be fine. \n\nIn the meantime, giving government more power over the media will not make things better. \n","d22hmfy":"RemindMe! 2 hours","d22hmx7":"I will be messaging you on [**2016-04-14 14:49:43 UTC**](http:\/\/www.wolframalpha.com\/input\/?i=2016-04-14 14:49:43 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebunkThis\/comments\/4eo2zi\/debunk_this_six_corporations_control_90_of_the\/d22hmfy)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebunkThis\/comments\/4eo2zi\/debunk_this_six_corporations_control_90_of_the\/d22hmfy]%0A%0ARemindMe!  2 hours) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Delete Comment&amp;message=Delete! d22hmx7)\n\n_____\n\n|[^([FAQs])](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RemindMeBot\/comments\/24duzp\/remindmebot_info\/)|[^([Custom])](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=[LINK INSIDE SQUARE BRACKETS else default to FAQs]%0A%0ANOTE: Don't forget to add the time options after the command.%0A%0ARemindMe!)|[^([Your Reminders])](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=List Of Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders!)|[^([Feedback])](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBotWrangler&amp;subject=Feedback)|[^([Code])](https:\/\/github.com\/SIlver--\/remindmebot-reddit)\n|-|-|-|-|-|","d232kwo":"This was the debunkage I was looking for.

There are obviously stations making a great deal of money, especially in large markets, but there are a lot of stations that are barely staying afloat whether they are locally or nationally owned.

Some most certainly were, but the contrast between what the Inca are known to have built and the foundations on which they built are glaring.\n\nExample:\n\nhttp:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-vCQLrosltso\/VjRTDvEJVkI\/AAAAAAAAEzA\/hZ5B4prL1pg\/s640\/IMG_4958.jpg\n\nSee if you can discern where \"the other builders\" left off, and where the Inca (et al) added to such structures.\n\nIf you found a rascally kid drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa with a Sharpie, would you ASSUME that the same kid must be the artist that originally painted the fucking Mona Lisa?\n\n(rhetorical question) ^ \n\n\n","e3bvtkk":"&gt;See if you can discern where \"the other builders\" left off, and where the Inca (et al) added to such structures.\n\nThe Inca built both. Fine, ashlar masonry takes a lot of work. It wasn't always feasible to use it for every structure (or even more than the foundation in some cases) in a complex. Also, Inca roofs were gigantic and hid much of the walls from view when present, marring our present interpretations of how the structures would look.","e3bnrks":"Look into graham Hancock\u2019s work","e3bp5lz":"I have and it's absolute bollocks. He doesn't know what he's talking about. It's easy to make up stuff about truly ancient cultures, but the Inca were around only 500 years ago. We know a ton about what they were up to and what they built.","e3brunj":"You do realize the Inca themselves say they weren't responsible for many of the monolithic structures, right?  And yet, it's otherwise thrown down our throats including the Inca's beliefs and knowledge of themselves is wrong.  But I'm sorry... you were saying?  lol","e3bsb43":"Yes, they weren\u2019t responsible for the two millennia of civilization and architecture that preceded them in the Andes. They were however responsible for Ollantaytambo which is the topic being discussed.","e3bsq6t":"Wrong again.  Many MANY examples of very different building styles often side-by-side are shown in terms of differences in size of rock (pounds versus tons in terms of weight\/size), cut (crudely placed and with clay\/mud versus precision cut with no bonding agent), precision (jigsaw placed for earthquake prevention versus standard stacking of boulders) and even dating (lykan patches present with relative good integrity versus severe degradation from weathering and earthquakes).  Two very unique styles of building and yet we are to think it's all from the same culture and period??\n\nDo you your own research and not what is taught for the masses of tourists who then think 'well, that is that'","e3btbo8":"Sure. There are cases where the Inca built on top of or beside older architecture. The Inca also used a variety of techniques and materials depending on the location and function of the structure. This has nothing to do with the claim that the Inca didn\u2019t build the impressive architecture at Ollantaytambo.","e3btyo2":"Think about what you just said.  Why would the Inca deviate from a far superior method of building only to what seems to rebuild and imitate those structures?  It's not as if you're going from Victorian mansion and replicating that on a smaller scale in suburbia. This variation in building style is so far beyond comparison from one another in terms of technological advancement and logistical planning, that we cannot even replicate some of the structures today.  \n\nLet me repeat that - we cannot replicate some of the structures today.  That's how advanced some of these things have been built and placed; the stuff the Inca's built right next to it or literally on top of is utter crap in comparison and it should be blatantly obvious.","e3bu9x3":"&gt;Why would the Inca deviate from a far superior method of building\n\nBecause fancy stonework is expensive and time-consuming.\n\n&gt;in terms of technological advancement and logistical planning, that we cannot even replicate some of the structures today\n\nYeah...bollocks. We can build sky-scrapers. I'm pretty sure we can cut up and stack some stones. \n\n&gt;Let me repeat that. We cannot replicate some of the structures today\n\nThis is simply untrue. We may not know exactly how they built it, but that's a different claim entirely.\n","e3c17yj":"Now you're nitpicking.","e3brbc9":"&gt;He doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nHe's been researching this for years. He's been on the ground exploring and uncovering evidence since probably before you were even born. What have you done, mr anything that goes against my world view is \"bollocks\"?","e3bshzq":"So, the length of his efforts are a testament to their validity? Appeal to effort falllacy we can call it. Why not actually defend the claim that the impressive architecture at Ollantaytambo wasn\u2019t built by the Inca? You\u2019ll find yourself short on credible sources on your side if you try.","e3btll5":"No. His validity is in the evidence that he has published in his works. He's been a researcher for years and time and time again has been proven right about **his findings**. Look into the man and his works because clearly you have no idea what you're talking about. ","e3bu0fw":"&gt;time and time again has been proven right about his findings\n\nAgain, bollocks. His central hypothesis about a global, technologically advanced civilization dating to 12,000 BC has no good evidence to support it. He cherry-picks stray pieces of information from the work of actual scientists in order to sell his books to a credulous public who find anything about the ancient world more complicated than Atlantis too taxing for their attention.","e3bufsd":"From geological evidence of erosion on the Great Sphinx to https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/13000-years-ago-gigantic-fires-consumed-the-world-causing-ice-age. He's been proven right numerous times and more will come out. \n\nYou can bet on that. The gatekeepers are losing their shit. Even the \"out of Africa\" theory is being debunked as we speak. I hope you and others truly have the mental fortitude for when it happens. Something tells me, you will fight tooth and nail defending Zahi Hawass until the end. Sad.","e3bv0r0":"So one line of evidence related to water erosion vs. literally all of the historical and archaeological evidence suggesting that the Sphinx is part of Old Kingdom Egypt? This gets trotted out every time because this is literally ALL you have. Next you'll just write \"Gobekle Tepe\" or \"Comet Impacts\" as if these phrases suffice for evidence of Hancock's extraordinary claims. What are the predictions of his global civilization hypothesis? This isn't science; it's cherry-picking.\n\nAlso, \"out of Africa\" is not being debunked. Just because anatomically modern humans interbred slightly with other species does not mean that modern humans did not originate in Africa.","e3bruw1":"Watch Graham Hancock's interviews on JRE. The guy's a Luciferian Gnostic.","e3dzssz":"I've been slowly coming to this conclusion too - the blue-beam might be more of a \"green beam\".... an \"awesome ancient civilization\" whose very discovery every human secretly hopes for - the [reappearance of the masters of wisdom since those first Atlantean days](https:\/\/youtu.be\/GbWMw249xY8?t=1h22m9s)","e3btgry":"Fascinating to see this being reported at such a mainstream source -- but...\n\n&gt; While the 481-foot pyramid built thousands of years ago for Pharaoh Khufu...\n\nHah!

There were no working taffic lights in the city.  Roads were jammed, but everyone went with the flow. It was cool.\n\nHired a personal guide for my wife and me. Surprisingly affordable. \n\nWhen we got off the plane, we got in a very long line for customs.\n\nOur hotel, Marriott, had sent a...greeter...to ease the process.\n\nHe introduced himself, told us to follow him. Strode to an empty customs booth and slapped the counter hard.  A customs person came over and told him (I assume) that the lane was closed.  He gestured at us and said, \"Americans.\"\n\nThe clerk smiled big and immediately processed us.  I felt funny about that. Not my style to jump line, but everyone, including the folks in line smiled warmly at us.\n\nLimo took us to the hotel. Guards we AKs waved at us.\n\nGot checked in. Hungry, went down to The Harry pub in the lobby.  Pics of Dirty Harry, Potter, etc decorated the walls.  Place was empty. One guy behind the bar.\n\nWe ordered drinks. Asked for menus. Service was slow, but that was ok.\n\nAs we were leaving we found out that the pub wasn't open and it was that fellows day off. But, he never mentioned it. Just gave us friendly service. Even had to make the run to a restaurant in the lobby to get our food. I felt awful. Tipped big.\n\nOur guide told most places that we went that we were Canadian. Said if he told them we were American they woukd have sent an armed guard with us everywhere.\n\nHe said it was very safe, but when it comes to Americans they don't take chances.\n\nHe drove us all over the country that week.\n\nThe days lasted so long - he would take us everywhere and give detailed history about everything. Finally we would get tired and ask to go back to the hotel.\n\nSwelled with pride when he said that the beloved Anwar Sadat and American President Jimmy Carter were best friends. \n\nEven asked us to come to his home for dinner to meet his family.\n\nHe had an apartment on the 5th floor with a perfect view of the pyramids.\n\nThe feast he laid out defies description.
