Both groups account for roughly 25% of the population.\n\nSo it's entirely possible that if you accounted for differential turnout according to both age and social class, you'd get a different result, and find that uniform turnout would have changed the results (ie voters represented a skewed sample of the electorate).

There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.\n\nSo this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.\n\nIf you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.\n\nEngen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.\n\nCanadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!\n\nSo - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.\n\nIf you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.journal.forces.gc.ca\/vo9\/no2\/16-engen-eng.asp\n\nhttp:\/\/qspace.library.queensu.ca\/bitstream\/1974\/1081\/1\/Engen_Robert_C_200803_MA.pdf\n\nIn the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.journal.forces.gc.ca\/vo9\/18-grossman-eng.asp","cgot99h":"*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.  I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's experience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight (or not) and the effect that it has on them.  It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true.  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?\n\nThe major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:\n\n&gt; \"Everyone stop!  OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let\u2019s see if Gruber over there fires at him.\"\n\nAlmost everything in this area is laced with bias.  Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology.  *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Dixon is a good example: Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One.\n\nAgainst this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research.  What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.","cgov9rv":"&gt;  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?\n\nWhat on earth?","cgovmm6":"Sleeping bags are comforting, and a bombardment can be *really* scary.  Also, there were accusations of incredible negligent and shoddy leadership on the Argentinian side (there were trials regarding to extremely poor treatment of the conscripts fairly recently), which would explain very poor reactions to incoming fire.  [Der Speigel article on the accusations](http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/international\/world\/argentina-s-falklands-war-veterans-cannon-fodder-in-a-war-we-couldn-t-win-a-475287.html)\n\nIn general, people do not act rationally when put under sudden and extreme stress, especially if there isn't any stable presence to guide their reactions.  If your commander is telling you to get to bunkers, directing you to positions, and acting like he's still in control of the situation, you're going to have a much better chance of reacting well.  Absent or poor leadership?  You're now scared, and have no idea what to do in this new, scary situation.  ","cgow0ij":"[deleted]","cgozga2":"As far as I know that term usually applies to the lack of knowledge of enemy unit positions rather than battlefield confusion.","cgovgf9":"I'll have to hunt out the exact passage if you want more gen, but despite having better places to take cover they resorted to using sleeping bags.  Remember that these were poorly trained conscripts. not professional soldiers.","cgosj18":"Also, Grossman cherry picks his battles. He commonly claims that artillery and other crew served weapons do the majority of killing even in a direct action, yet one can with very little trouble find several battles where one or both sides had little trouble inflicting terrific casualties on the other using accurate and deliberate fire, without artillery being involved. The Battle of Inkerman would be my favourite example. ","cgovloe":"In other words, all those bullets went somewhere?","cgowtkc":"Above all, the Allied infantry was more than willing to lay fire at their oncoming Russian counterparts with devastating accuracy, which runs counter to Grossman's entire thesis. ","cgosp65":"This is a great answer. I have read all 3 books you mention, discussed it with professors and veterans. Many people agree that his number is either fabricated or based off a \"gut feeling.\" \n\nWhat is important about Marshal's work is that it brings to light much more than just the firing rate. There are whole sections on command and training that have been accepted and incorporated into modern training. \n\nFor Grossman, I feel like his point was a bit weak. Basing your work on already shaky research makes it hard to come to a clear and concise point. Linking violent video games to aggressive behaviour is popular and sells copies, but that might just be my biased interpretation of things. Like \/u\/kombatminipig said, he is very selective in his evidence.\n\nFinally Engen. All I can say is that he is a top notch academic, and *Canadians Against Fire* is a solid piece of work. \n\n","cgozxp9":"Could someone track down the records of ammunition given to each soldier before and after each battle and from there find out how many soldiers fired their weapons?  Or do those records not exist?","cgp1rob":"If the records did exist, they wouldn't prove that the soldiers fired their weapons at the enemy, just that they were fired at all.","cgpkpmc":"I feel like Grossman would argue that the ammo was discarded, or given to the few that were firing, and that everyone then lied about where it went. Because camaraderie.","cgplad0":"You could also check the guns to determine if they'd been fired.  Soldiers trading weapons to hide the fact that some aren't doing their jobs seems unreasonably complicated.","cgpldfl":"Well, we can't check the guns of WWII soldiers now, and I would be surprised to find a primary source on that suitable for statistical analysis.\n\nAmmo consumption would be possible to find sources on, I'm just not sure how fine grained it would be.

","cgoq9oi":"This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the 15%-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted.\n\nFor one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only 15-20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an exposed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons (machine guns), and key weapons (flamethrowers).\n\nWhile his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an exposed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves?\n\n[This](http:\/\/strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil\/pubs\/parameters\/Articles\/03autumn\/chambers.pdf) is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war (which came up with a 50% fire rate). Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of.\n\nSimply put... it's just not very good history. It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns, but the 15-20% is more or less impossible to back up, and completely ignores several significant factors.","cgoz2di":"It's also talking about \"at an exposed enemy soldier\".  Meaning that pointing in the general direction of the enemy doesn't count.  But, per an earlier comment, the soldier can still be firing their weapon and therefore using up ammunition and causing wear on their gun barrel.","cgos90i":"Isn't the term American riflemen referring to Marines, making those arguments about their duties etc null?","cgoth7x":"The term \"riflemen\" can be applied to everyone with a rifle. I believe you are thinking of the phrase \"Every marine is a rifleman\". While that is true, the reverse is not (Not every rifleman is a marine).","cgotj5c":"Firstly, no, \"riflemen\" is not specific to the Marines.\n\nSecondly, I suspect you're referring to \"every Marine is a rifleman first.\" This does not mean that the Marines consist of no role but infantry riflemen, but only that Marines of all roles are expected to be competent to effectively engage in combat with a rifle. The Marines still have people performing all the different duties that any other branch does.","cgoq924":"Probably referring to S. L. A. Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places:\n\n&gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average 100 men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only 15 men on average would take any part with the weapons.  This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25% of total strength from the opening to the close of an action.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector...\n\nMarshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today.  [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific](http:\/\/strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil\/pubs\/parameters\/Articles\/03autumn\/chambers.pdf), and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy.  (Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill.  These weren't firing lines 100 yards apart.  Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone.)\n\nStill, after WWII they led to innovations in training to increase rate of fire.","cgoq6kj":"Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of explosions and confusions during war, keep in mind 20% of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ 0 (over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis). Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like \"Brennan\u2019s account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshall\u2019s use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Army\ncaptain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could not\nrecall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall the\njournalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea.\" ^1\n\nI would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book \/ biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life (although later he does kill a German soldier). ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between 25,000 to 100,000 rounds were expended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy (few people want to kill another person).\n\nI also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain.\n\n\nI apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r\/military\/ or r\/asksocialscience\/ .\n\n\nOn a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire. \n\n\n\nReferences:\n0.

One group of soldiers, firing from cover, works to get as much lead flying in the general direction of the opposition in an attempt to hinder their ability to fire on another group of their comrades that are relocating elsewhere.  It's basically meant to be psychological, discouraging the enemy from doing anything more active than taking cover.

You have to understand that seing a target at engagement ranges (100m to 300m) is actually quite hard, especially in a conflict like Vietnam with all the vegetation.

Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively.  Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use.  It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes.  \n\nIs nicotine good for you?  No, its not.  It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems.  However, caffeine and ethanol are both \"not good\" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects.  It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the \"worst\" thing in a cig.\n\nJust to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it.\n\n&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK \u2014 Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.\n\nNicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction\n\n\nAlso, wikipedia has alot of this information.\n\nNow, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe.  This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent.  This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe.  They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient.  My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.","chft89x":"Any decent e-cig has a silica wick than can't burn, and nicotine juice is pretty simple stuff, some ratio or another of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin nicotine and some flavorings. Not much you can cut corners on and still get decent \"smoke.\" Propylene glycol has a pretty good body of research saying it's harmless in the quantities you could possibly be smoking, it's used for medical vaporizers. Vegetable glycerin I'm admittedly not so sure of, but so far as I know there's no known issues caused by vaporizing it. I suppose the various flavorings added could theoretically cause issues, it's hard to say exactly what they're made of. That said, I'd put a good amount of money on most people having zero or negligible health impact from the non-nicotine components of e-cig juice. Unless you're smoking those sketchy cheapo things they sell at gas stations.

I imagine Murdoch's burning a lot of bridges to get this story to run.","d0spzen":"He probably doesn't care anymore.  ","d0srkxx":"IIRC he's on record as being a republican.","d0t7s73":"ONE OF US. ONE OF US.","d0tbhlb":"What august company you republicans keep. Murdoch and Sinn Fien.","d0te524":"British republicanism is probably the only camp where Sinn Fien and Oliver Crowmwell can possibly occupy the same space.","d0sph03":"&gt; It'll be interesting to see how the Queen reacts, because if she denies backing Brexit it will show that she supports the EU. \n\nSeems to me like it's just a case of the Sun trying to goad some sort of response out of Buckingham Palace that they can call a statement of support for one side or the other. Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this:\n\n&gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. \n\nIt all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its \"highly reliable source\". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing.\n\n&gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \u201cThe Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims.\"\n\nSeems entirely reasonable.\n\nThe Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should \"think very carefully\", that means that \n\n&gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. \n\nand that therefore\n\n&gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don\u2019t voters have a right to know what it is?\n\nPretty unimpressive from The Sun.","d0t570o":"Why do you think the Sun printed it? They know shes not going to deny it even if she wanted to. She takes being non-political very seriously.\n\n","d0sp3e0":"Denying backing brexit doesn't mean she's pro EU. She won't say anything except there may be some snarky releases from her staff about this front page but nothing substansive.  Not being involved is her shtick and she will try not to sway opinion as best she can.","d0srmdk":"I think even if thise were true (and I am highly doubtful it is) then it's not exactly a revelation. I think pretty much everyone thinks the EU is heading in the wrong direction. The question is what do we do about it. The remain group want to stay and reform it, using the influence of being in the group to make changes. The leave group believe it is beyond reform and never will be what we want.\n\nAlso denying backing Brexit does not mean that she supports staying, that's a fallacy.","d0su7d4":"Some people actually like the direction the EU is going in. Also 'reform' can mean a lot. The more Eurosceptic remain supporters want to see a weaker more diluted EU while the more ardent supporters want to see a stronger EU. I personally would support an even more unified Europe but I'm also a filthy pseudo-foreigner (Irish).","d0t65m7":"So I understand the appeal of a unified europe, even to the extent of a federal entity with current nations as states. But what do you feel about the direction that this is going with regard to things like the lack of accountability in elections?\n\nFor example the US are having a big debate at the moment to decide their new leader. There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that. We're just told Junker is the president as voted for by the leaders of each nation.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/President_of_the_European_Commission#Appointment\n\nWell why should I trust Cameron to pick the right person? Also why do leaders of nations with a population of a few million get the same say as leaders of nations with a population of over 50 million?\n\nSurely something as important as who our president is should be something that the entirety of the EU population should get a say in? And this is something that should have bene built in right at the start, not something that we are aspirationally moving towards.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?","d0t6hfd":"Did you vote for Cameron to become Prime Minister? No, you voted for an MP and he was selected by MPs.\n\nThis is how the appointment of the EU president is supposed to work too. It should be someone appointed by and who commands a majority of the EU parliament, this is how many countries select their leader and I have no problem with that. Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president.\n\nAlso don't forget, everything the EU tries to pass MUST be approved by EU parliament which has proportional representation and Britain due to its population has a gigantic number of MEPs representing it. ","d0u2vle":"And that would be fine if Junker were the leader of the largest party of MEPs and campaigned as their leader during the election. That would be transparency.\n\nCameron trying to stop it is as much of a problem as any of the other leaders trying to support it. The point is that these decisions are taken far away from the electorate with zero accountability. I doubt the US population would be happy with their president being selected by all the state governors under the argument that any law has to be passed by the House anyway.\n\nThis is not even close to democratic. FPTP for all its flaws at least is an election. Why are you supporting a system that diminishes the power of voters?","d0u5ske":"Well the US president is selected by the electoral college who do have the power to ignore the popular vote but obviously that is not really relevant.\n\nThe EU is trying to make the election of the president more transparent. Bizarrely, it's the people who argue that the EU needs reform such as Cameron who oppose such changes. \n\nAlso I support the EU because as an Irish citizen, I have seen directly the good it has done for my country. I also see real attempts to make the system fairer and more democratic through documents like the Lisbon treaty.","d0t5zw4":"&gt; I personally would support an even more unified Europe but I'm also a filthy pseudo-foreigner (Irish).\n\nThat's great. You'll probably get your wish sooner rather than later if we leave. ","d0sp3eg":"Well, she can say that her comments to Mr. Clegg were not endorsement of a Leave vote. And hopefully maintain her impartiality ","d0spd4e":"Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a \"capstone of a United States of Europe\". The Lisbon treaty (an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well) passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme.  \n\nBoth here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics. I am sick of the federal question being avoided by these people. No other trade group has a foreign minister and serious proposals for an army, it's a farce to see people pretend this is all about trade, it's a federation.","d0sqnca":"I won't dispute that Guy wants greater integration, but its disingenuous two mention that without pointing out that he is calling for a \"two speed Europe\"; i.e. the eurozone nations would pull together in order for the single currency to be effective as possible, whereas counties which want to stay out of the euro like the UK, Sweden and Poland would be \"associate members\" under his ideas, with an opt out of further integration, but full access to the single market. Which if you ask me sounds like the best way forwards for europe.","d0ss3e5":"I am not so sure we can take anything that's said by these people on face value anymore. Two speeds maybe, but there's only one destination. Look at the bullying of Switzerland at the moment now they have it encircled. That's what would happen to an \"associate member\" sooner or later. I can't believe that's being done partially in my name. It's a disgrace.  \n\nThese people have not stopped when the people have clearly told them to stop by shooting down treaties, I don't think we can consider them to be playing an honest democratic game at this point.","d0sumqj":"&gt; Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a \"capstone of a United States of Europe\"...\n\nThere are many things to criticise Clegg for but attacking him because someone who wasn't even an MEP until 2009 (Clegg stood down as an MEP in 2004), who now leads the political group that didn't exist until after Clegg left the European Parliament (and which formed out of a merger of the group Clegg was part of and another group), is an EU Federalist, is a bit of a stretch.","d0sulze":"It's funny how the leave supporters on here seem to be delighted when their elected government is possibly undermined by a decidedly undemocratic institution. The irony.","d0t6tqs":"This implies she's actively trying to interfere, which she isnt.\n\nPersonally i'm glad the Queen of England considers herself British rather than 'European'","d0t8v1r":"A minor point but there hasn't been a Queen of England for 300+ years. England stopped being a kingdom in the 1700s - also kind of in the 1500s when it absorbed Wales, but it kept the name that time.","d0t6wc5":"True, I don't think she is trying to interfere but some people in this thread do and yet support it.","d0t6g7c":"Urm, not really mate. ","d0t5b3i":"I too have heard from anonymous sources that overheard Prince William, our future monarch and the most popular royal, was unabashedly pro-European and hoped the time would come with it would become a federal entity but with a constitutional monarchy that would switch households every decade with his European counterparts. Completely anonymous but totally trusted sources.","d0t6klo":"That could be kind of cool. Take turns on the imperial throne.","d0snr2f":"Yeah, but she doesn't does she?  \n\nOr should I say; if she does, we wouldn't hear about it.","d0t52xv":"Well, the two people in the conversation were apparently the Queen and Nick Clegg. They both deny it. The other party in this claim is The Sun. \n\nThe Sun. \n\nWhich of course we can trust because it's not like they're heavily biased to campaign for an exit because they have a tyrannical media puppet master owner who wants out nor have they ever printed blatant lies to sell newspapers and further their agenda. \n\n\/s","d0srht3":"We know the Queen wants Scotland to stay in the UK, therefore she will be firmly in the remain camp.","d0ss134":"The Queen backing anything as big as this is absolutely undemocratic. I don't believe for a moment she is so stupid.","d0t72fs":"From what I gather, she made the comment at a private dinner, that's not an attack on democracy ffs","d0sso8y":"The queen who has given more than anyone for this country, who lived through the 2nd World War, who has seen us through many conflicts, and the great depression. I'm sure a little kid on the internet calling her stupid really cuts deep.\n\nShe is entitled to have an opinion of her own, whether you like it or not. Now before you explode with phony outrage, answer me this. Why is the queen stating her opinion on the matter provided sh has little power 'undemocratic'? She isn't enforcing anything on to us by stating what she thinks.","d0t6023":"&gt; who has given more than anyone for this country\n\nIn what way?","d0t79yj":"Some people see feasts and banqueting as hard work worth a salary of millions. ","d0su15x":"It's undemocratic because she has far more power than my grandma or any other citizen eligible to vote. Because she has the ability to speak to the Prime Minister directly despite having no explicit approval from the 'demos' I think voicing her opinions in this way is wrong. \n\nWhy are you attacking me as a 'little kid on the internet'? Please attack my opinions...\n\nI actually have a lot of respect for The Queen, when I said I didn't believe her to be this stupid I meant it. My belief is that The Sun is misrepresenting or misinterpreting her words. I hope you don't see this as a personal attack on her, when I really didn't mean it maliciously.\n\nThis is sort of unrelated but something you bought up: Do you extend the honour of 'seeing us through the great depression' to anyone who was alive during the time, I certainly don't see how our current Queen had any influence on it. Being as she was, roughly 4 years old when it started.","d0t63v5":"Even as the 4 year old Princess Elizabeth, she was *very* careful not to express her opinion publicly as to whether or not the gold standard should be abandoned. \n\nFact. ","d0ta8x6":"she did like doing nazi salutes though","d0stser":"Although she is a symbol of Britain the issue arises from how the British system of government is set up. The British system entirely relies on convention which is what stops the queen from exercising her power to stop legislation passed in parliament and the Lords from blocking money bills. However, these conventions are also not able to stand in a court or enforceable in anyway essentially acting as agreements. This means that the monarch backing a political narrative is an issue because it goes against the convention that the monarchy stays out of politics and strides close to the queen actually influencing legislation which can't happen in a democracy.  ","d0sp781":"This is hilarious","d0sy05r":"I could have sworn they attacked Prince William about a month ago for being seen to be getting involved in the debate?","d0t20eo":"Well, it is the most important meal of the day. She didn't get to that age by skipping it, y'know.  \n\nThe whole story sounds like a poor attempt to galvanize people, and sounds pretty fictional to me. Sure is nice that we have press in this country that is allowed to print outright lies on the front cover of their newspapers in the name of a political agenda. Such a great way to run a society. ","d0t5rol":"Makes sense the sun would run with this, after murdochs statement that a UK out of Europe would be easier to control there is reason for him to spread his poison swill.","d0t7h0e":"The Queen is famous about keeping quiet about her political views. Unfortunately, this was likely going to happen at some point because she made a rare point of telling people she wished Scotland would stay in the Union. Given the intelligence she shows in her speeches, somehow I doubt she'd be privy to hypocrisy the likes of which the Sun is accusing her of, but then again the Sun is a Murdoch machine and I wouldn't be surprised if they claimed that Jesus and Winston Churchill were Brexiters as well.","d0t4c1h":"&gt;\u201cThe reason we all sing God Save The Queen so heartily is because we always believe she is there to protect us from European encroachment.\u201d\n\nSomeone needs to tell JRM our queen is German. Bit late to be worrying about foreign infiltration...Either way i can imagine the butthurt if the article was \"random person claims queen supports EU as brexit is a load of chancers\"","d0t7z6p":"How is the Queen German?

","d0t8cib":"I'm a Dane, here to conquer yer bloody country you anglo-saxon poofs! arrrrggg.","d0t8gfb":"Interesting factoid \"Ta'\" in the north is related to the Danish word (Tak). A lot of northern Lingo is scandic in Origin due to their heavier influence on that area. Possibly pretty obvious but I was mind blown as never really thought about it before I was told it. I was so used to just laughing at Scottish people whenever they claim they're Scandinavian that I never thought of the origins of it. ","d0t8kd1":"Wow, that is fascinating! I hope you never mock our proud Scandi heritage again.","d0t8u90":"Oh I accept the heritage. But I just find this thing of \"oh we're closer to scandinavians than the English\" on the same level of delusion as American Irish people.

","d0t8ed1":"Well the name was changed from Saxeburg G\u00f6the in 1917 to because everyone hated the germans at that point so a bit more recent and a bit more relevant. \n\nThe main point I make is it's a bit silly claiming the queen is some symbol of British purity or whatever when she and the whole of the royal family almost a perfect example of the opposite. \n\n\nSpecial note aside for the usual Moggy cringiness of \"Why we all heartily sing God Save the Queen\". Huge fan of the guy on most stuff. but honestly If I didn't know who the guy was I would have thought he was American with how he seems to live in some twee alternative reality of the UK where we all skip around in bowler hats and toast the queen while Jerusalem plays in the background. ","d0t9w9s":"Being against the EU is nothing to do with 'British purity'. You've invented that idea to justify the silly quip that the Queen is German because some of her ancestors are German, knowing full well that it's no less racist than saying a black person can't be British because their ancestors are African.","d0t9zhf":"I'm allowed to quip all I want when we're coming out with complete bollocks about the Queen protecting us from \"european enroachment\". Especially coming from a man who seems to be living in a foreigners sketch of British stereotypes. It's a complete nonsense statement in the first place. I thought the unbe-leavers were meant to be the humorless ones? ","d0ta15q":"It is, and so is calling the Queen German.","d0ta9z1":"Holy crap the butthurt I've unleashed from a quip. Sory for daring to make jokes about a stupid statement. I shall stay in silence for fear of triggering anyone.

It's a joke about a dumb statement. I wouldn't even care if the queen was a full on WW1 German stereotype spiked helmet and everything anyway. \n\n\nMaking a joke at someones ignorance of how intertwined european royal families are and have always been is not quite the same as discussing racial purity theories is probably why people wouldn't react the same way.

While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences, these are purely things that will happen. Copying and pasting ruins the formatting, so here's a short sample:\n\n- The UK will leave all EU treaties after 2 years from a \u201cNo\u201d vote unless. For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if:\n- A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement.\n- All 27 remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this.\n- Trade deals alone take 5-10 years or more.

The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.\n\nThe way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying \"something causes itself\". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.\n\nNow where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.\n\nI hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.\n\n(I'm a student in my 3rd year of environmental science with year 1 being mostly CC so AMA I guess?) ","dc5tlvz":"Oh oh, Skeptoid did an episode about this recently! Another important thing to note is that we can tell the difference between carbon sources based on the amount of C14 isotopes they have. Since C14 is made in the atmosphere and likes to decay, things that are alive have proportions of C14 to C12 in line with the atmosphere, with some notable exceptions. Things that are dead lose their C14 as it decays to the more stable C12. Since the stuff we're concerned about is \"fossil fuel\", fuel derived from the remains of long-dead life forms, it has no remaining C14. We can check the proportion of our atmosphere composed of C14 to C12 and tell that the vast majority of added carbon in the CO2 is C12. The only other real source of massive amounts of C12 being pumped into the atmosphere is volcanoes, and we know how much CO2 they're pumping out. It's much less than the increase of CO2 we're experiencing, doesn't explain the increase.","dc48u9i":"I know the consensus is real, but I would like to specifically debunk the info in this particular article.   I see that the quotes in the article are taken from a book about climate denial.

You end up arguing things that really shouldn't matter - it doesn't matter whether 2, 50 or 97% of scientists \"endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming\" - and arguing the percentage is a waste of time. If they want to argue against man made climate change they need to provide evidence that the climate isn't changing due to man's actions.\n\nStill - here we are.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of 489 randomly selected scientists, the 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at 11,944 abstracts - I believe there have been others. The site seems to ignore these.\n\nThe other things that jump out at me are.\n\n&gt; the researchers then selected 79 of their sample and declared them \u201cexperts.\"\n\nWell no the researchers did not do that, those surveyed did - by publishing papers on climate change - it shouldn't be a surprise that out of 3,146 scientists only 79 of them were climate scientists... It's a poor way to decide if man made climate change is correct or not - but I don't think the poll claims that it is.\n\n&gt; So if I send out an email survey to 1000 people, and then I hand-pick the 75 responses I like the best, then can I proclaim those results to be \"settled science\" too? Will Al Gore champion my cause and demand billions in reparations from first world nations on my behalf?\n\nNo because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.\n\nSo sure, if we ignore all other surveys that confirm the statistic - then this alone as a support for anthropomorphic climate change is weak, usefully there are other things supporting man made climate change other than one email poll.","dc48uvz":"[deleted]","dc48xkk":"Ew","dc4ltjr":"you would think this guy would know bunk when he sees it. look at all the bunk for sale on that page alone","dc5n87i":"The linked article does have an element of truth in it, in that the statistic is often stated incorrectly.

The scientists explained it fully in their publication.\n\nIt's also relevant (but not addressed in the NaturalNews article) that several independent studies have been done using different methods, and reached very similar conclusions.

A few additional points : \n\n* The bulk of the mass (90% or more of total mass!) that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. \n* * See the fuel paradox section of this article https:\/\/medium.com\/@landingattempts\/why-do-rockets-use-so-much-fuel-118486244aba\n* As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape (1\/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth)\n* *  Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth.\n* * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper.\n* The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without expending further fuel (although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first)\n* * This was used for practical effect in Apollo 13 where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to \"turn around\" at the time that the accident happened\n* * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian\n* During the trip to\/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again (absent using the gravity well for that purpose) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you 30 days, or 35 days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost\/weight of the fuel to do it in 5 days less is prohibitive). - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out.

Based on [a couple](http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2018\/jul\/12\/donald-trump\/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud\/) of [sources](https:\/\/www.nato.int\/cps\/ie\/natohq\/topics_67655.htm) the US contributes 22% of Nato's common fund, and about 70% of Nato military spending.\n\nOn immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:\n\n&gt;  It\u2019s not good for Europe and it\u2019s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We\u2019re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don\u2019t have immigration laws \u2014 I don\u2019t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you\u2019re tied in a lawsuit for five years.\n\nOn the UK-US special relationship:\n\n&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it\u2019s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough \u2014 if they don\u2019t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It\u2019s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.\n\nOn Russia invading Ukraine:\n\n&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We\u2019ll have to see what happens ... I\u2019m not bad at doing things. Let\u2019s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.\n\nOn Theresa May:\n\n&gt;  She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.\n\nOn the Russia meeting:\n\n&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it\u2019s a dream, but it\u2019s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I\u2019m not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia. People say \u2018he loves Russia\u2019 - I love the U.S. I love China and I love other countries.","e2by0v1":"He went on about how great he did with North Korea at that presser too.\n\nThough: [Congress Moves to Force Trump to Come Clean on North Korea Talks](https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/congress-moves-to-force-trump-to-come-clean-on-north-korea-talks)","e2bm7jj":"[deleted]","e2bn2na":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Dh_rrV2XUAA5Pe2?format=jpg\n\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Dh_s5E_UEAEQchh?format=jpg\n\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Dh_mGu2XcAYXLu7?format=jpg\n\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Dh_uGGNVMAMjqlN?format=jpg","e2bmmaf":"&gt;Trump arrived in Scotland on 23\/6\/16\n\n\nhttps:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/746272130992644096?lang=en\n\n\n\ud83e\udd14","e2bv4kg":"[This is the better tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/746144027616120833): he left the US on Thursday 23rd... but by then it was already Friday in the UK.","e2c1n3o":"Yeah seems like he is either blatantly lying or can't remember, which is worse?","e2bmznl":"[deleted]","e2bnx3x":"&gt;I produce a reputable source (Newsweek) stating that he arrived in Scotland on 23rd June\n\nAre you also saying Trump is a liar?","e2bohwd":"[deleted]","e2bov9u":"In this case skewing overwhelmingly towards lie","e2bpzne":"[deleted]","e2bta92":"Lol it doesn't though","e2btp0f":"[deleted]","e2bxe5j":"Soooooo.... https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/746144027616120833\n\nWhen he says \"just about to leave to go to Scotland\" in the early hours of the 24th..\n What do you think that means?","e2c1gqf":"\"Well if you remember I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit\"\n\nFrom the press conference earlier today\n\nI mean that is a blatant lie","e2bn5f2":"You seem confused, so here's also the Telegraph confirming 23rd: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2016\/06\/23\/donald-trump-arrives-in-the-uk-saying-he-would-be-inclined-to-le\/\n\n&gt;Instead he will open a golf resort.

Direct commercial flights take 6-8 hours, so depending on how he travelled, he might have arrived in the UK just on 23rd June in the western parts of the US.\n\nAt a guess, President Trump's press office said he'd be flying to Scotland on Thursday 23rd (which is true), and that got repeated by the UK press by without checking for time zones, and also got turned from \"leaving on 23rd\" to \"arriving on 23rd\" by mistake.","e2bv63q":"[deleted]","e2bvyo9":"Find a better source than his tweet?\n\nTalking of sources, based on [this article](https:\/\/www.yorkshirepost.co.uk\/news\/politics\/general-election\/timeline-how-referendum-night-unfolded-1-7980730) Farage claimed victory at 4am, Galloway at roughly 2.35am, with projections of a Leave win beginning around 12.30am. The BBC and ITV called the election at roughly 4.40am. All of which would have been while President Trump was on the plane.\n\nSecondly, let's look at what he actually said, based on [this transcript](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2018\/07\/13\/full-text-theresa-may-trump-visit-transcript-718569):\n\n&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.\n\nSo it doesn't matter if he flew into the UK on 23rd (he didn't), or if technically the result hadn't been called when he arrived (it had been), because his claim was about opening the course the day before.\n\nSo even if we take \"Brexit\" to be on 24th June (rather than the day of the vote) he was still wrong.
